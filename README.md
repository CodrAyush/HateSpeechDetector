# Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for detecting hate speech in text data. The model is trained to classify text as either hate speech or non-hate speech, helping to identify and moderate harmful content.

## Dataset
The project uses a curated dataset (`Dataset---Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Deep-Learning.csv`) containing labeled examples of hate speech and non-hate speech text. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the deep learning model.

## Project Structure
- `Hate_Speech_Detection_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation including:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model architecture
  - Training process
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Usage examples
- `Dataset---Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Deep-Learning.csv`: Training dataset
